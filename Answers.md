-Server side routing is when the client request a document from the server, and the server responds by sending the required document, like when you click a link and the url changes, the server finds a file to deliver to the user. This involves page refreshes which client side routing can ignore.
-Client-side routing means that the client is doing all of the heavy lifting, as far as changing views and moving data around goes. Interaction with the server is done through AJAX calls that are used only when the application requires it.
